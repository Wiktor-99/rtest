# Test Tools ROS

This repository provides a suite of tools and utilities tailored for testing and debugging ROS2 (Robot Operating System) applications. It aims to simplify the development and testing workflows for ROS2-based projects, particularly in scenarios involving integration testing. 

The tools in this repository address challenges posed by ROS2's inter-process communication, which can lead to inconsistent test results. By focusing on integration testing without revalidating the underlying RMW (ROS Middleware) implementations, this repository ensures a more streamlined and reliable testing process.
